## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Pre-requisites üìã

Since this is a front-end project built with standard web technologies, you only need:

* **A Web Browser:** Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) to view the `index.html` file.
* **A Text Editor or IDE:** (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text) if you plan to modify the code.

### Installation üîß

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the project files:https://github.com/Erik2007-bot/F1_LDN_ERIK
    ```bash
    git clone 

    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Directory**
    Change your current directory to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd f1-erik
    ```
3.  **Launch the Project**
    Open the main HTML file in your browser.
    * *Example (Linux/macOS):*
        ```bash
        open index.html
        ```
    * *Example (Windows):*
        ```bash
        start index.html
        ```

You should now see the F1 website displaying the home section. Use the **"See More" button** on the homepage to demo the smooth scroll functionality.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Tests

*(Since this is a basic educational project focused on HTML/CSS layout and simple JS interaction, there are no formal unit or end-to-end tests implemented.)*

## üì¶ Deployment

Since this is a static site (HTML, CSS, JS only), deployment is straightforward:

1.  **GitHub Pages:** Push the code to your GitHub repository and activate GitHub Pages for the `main` branch.
2.  **Other Hosts:** Simply upload the entire `f1-erik/` directory (including `index.html`, `css/`, `js/`, and `img/`) to any static web hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or an FTP server).
